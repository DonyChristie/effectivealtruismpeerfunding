## Peer-to-Peer Funding For Effective Altruists

We believe in decentralized, highly liquid markets for effective altruists to support each other as they work to make the world a much better place. Philanthropists and grantmakers do not have the attention to evaluate and distribute really tiny grants for things like prizes for writing EA Forum articles. There are many people with small amounts of money and many opportunities to direct small amounts of money to, but these opportunities are hidden because often the people who could use money the most are too shy to ask for it. 

The Facebook group (pretty inactive, so far). This website is a step in the direction of formalizing this project. 

It may be the case that this project is subsumed under some other infrastructure, or that there is no one infrastructure but a multiplicity that can serve these functions.
